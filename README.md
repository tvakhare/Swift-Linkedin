LinkedinSwift is a project for managing native LinkedIn SDK using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

Latest version 0.8 is based on [LinkedIn SDK 1.0.6](https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/developer/sdk/iOS/li-ios-sdk-1.0.6-release.zip).

## How to use

```ruby
pod 'LinkedinSwift', '~> 0.8'
```

## Known issues

It turns out 1.0.6 release note: `Added Bitcode support.` is a lie. So you need to turn off Bitcode to make it work.
